This page contains a list of known Apple closed-source projects that we would like to see Apple release as open-source or binary-only roots.
Packages here should meet the following requirements:
1. Package should be extremely useful to PureDarwin
2. Package's potential release as open-source should not be unreasonable (eg, Foundation-667.22)
3. Packages listed here should include justification as to why they would be useful.
