XBS
===
### What is XBS?
In case you come across the term "<span style="font-weight:bold">XBS</span>": Apparently, this is what Apple's <span style="font-weight:bold">Build and Integration team</span> uses to compile projects for Mac OS X. It is a proprietary build system and is not available outside Apple. 

For the outside world, there is [[DarwinBuild]] instead. 
It is not known how much the two build systems have in common.
