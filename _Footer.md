The Wiki pages were recently moved from [Google Sites](https://sites.google.com/a/puredarwin.org/puredarwin/) and in the conversion process some formatting was lost. Please help fixing the markdown of this page by editing it. But please delete nothing, especially not (broken) images; fix them instead (see the main page of the Wiki for an example).
