Darwin XNU kernel patches released by Voodoo Labs
=================================================
The Open Source community around Darwin is picking up momentum big way: Today, the Xnu-Dev project has released a set of patches for the XNU kernel that powers Mac OS X and other Darwin-based operating systems. The patches greatly broaden hardware support of the XNU kernel, allowing it to run on Pentium M, Pentium 4, Turion 64, Athlon 64 and Phenom. Like the XNU kernel itself, the patches are released under the Apple Public Source License (APSL), which makes them suitable for inclusion in Darwin-based distributions like the one the PureDarwin project is working on.

Darwin is the Open Source foundation of Mac OS X. Voodoo Labs is a group of contributors who work on the source of the XNU kernel, the core of Darwin. PureDarwin is a project to make Darwin more usable by providing installation media, documentation and add-on software.
