Apple Releases Latest Darwin Project under Apache License: Thank You, Apple!
============================================================================
Today Apple Inc. released a new project as Open Source: <span style="font-weight:bold">AutoZone</span>, the Mac OS X Objective-C Garbage Collector that made its debut in Mac OS X Leopard last year.

With the release of [autozone-77.1](http://www.opensource.apple.com/darwinsource/10.5.5/autozone-77.1/) as the latest Darwin project, Apple demonstrates continuing [commitment](http://www.apple.com/opensource/) to the Open Source community, allowing the larger Open Source community to benefit from recent developments in core OS technologies.


Especially noteworthy is the fact that unlike most other Darwin components, AutoZone is not released under the Apple Public Source License (APSL), but under the more liberal [Apache License 2.0](http://www.opensource.apple.com/darwinsource/10.5.5/autozone-77.1/LICENSE). For this, we'd like to say: <span style="font-weight:bold">Thank you, Apple!</span>
