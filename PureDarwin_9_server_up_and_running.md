PureDarwin 9 server up and running
==================================
A PureDarwin 9 server is up and running (in private, for now - see below). 

We have created a custom PureDarwin 9 ISO with the scripts and tools from our repository as described [here](../developers/repository.html), installed [networking](../developers/network.html), [OpenSSH](../users/users/ssh.html), [Apache](../users/apache.html), [MacPorts](../developers/macports/macportsonpuredarwin.html), [Netatalk](../users/netatalk.html), configured [Bonjour](../users/bonjour.html), even installed [TightVNC](../users/vnc.html) for graphical applications... set up [SpeedStep](../users/speedstep.html) to save some power... all runing nicely. 

Thanks for everyone who has contributed toward making PureDarwin this viable.

At the moment we are looking for a co-location and hardware sponsor so that we can run a PureDarwin 9 server system 24/7 and make available its services publicly.
