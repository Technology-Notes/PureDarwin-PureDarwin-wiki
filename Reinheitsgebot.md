Congratulations, you have found an easter egg: German law mandates that only certain ingredients can go into beer. Similarly, PureDarwin purity law mandates that only open source frameworks and libraries may be used. 

The *Reinheitsgebot* is the German law that regulates wich ingredients can go into beer: water, barley, hops and malt. (Only recently has it been updated by the Provisional German Beer law, which also allows wheat an cane sugar). For more information on the *Reinheitsgebot*, see Wikipedia: [German purity law](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinheitsgebot).
