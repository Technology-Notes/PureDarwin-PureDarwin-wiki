We are a welcoming community of open source enthusiasts and developers. Everyone is invited to join the [PureDarwin project](welcome/about.html), as long as you agree to promote true open source spirit and abide by any [licenses](legal.html) that apply. Unix knowledge is a must at this point.

If you would like to get an puredarwin.org account, please visit #puredarwin on irc.freenode.net. Also, send an e-mail, including your full name, contact information and your desired puredarwin username (ideally the same as your IRC nickname) to admin@puredarwin.org.Â 

If you like, you can also include information about your hardware so that we can coordinate testing better.
