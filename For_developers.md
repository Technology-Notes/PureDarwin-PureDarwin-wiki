### Prerequisites
In order to do any serious PureDarwin development, please familiarize yourself with the [DarwinBuild](developers/darwinbuild.html) project and the [MacPorts](developers/macports.1.html) project, as there are the key component to build software for Darwin.
### PureDarwin releases
See [PureDarwin Xmas](downloads/xmas.html).
If you want to have a look at a minimalistic bootable Darwin 9 system, check out [PureDarwin nano](downloads/puredarwin-nano.html).
### Testers wanted {style="color:rgb(0,0,0);margin-top:10px;margin-right:10px;margin-bottom:10px;margin-left:0px"}
To qualify as a tester for the current PureDarwin installer, you need
An Intel Mac with Leopard (to run the installer and to test whether the PureDarwin USB thumbdrive can be booted)
Alternatively or both:
-   USB thumbdrive 1GB or larger (will be completely erased)
-   Latest VMware, [VirtualBox](developers/virtualbox.html) release
Fast Internet connection (to download Darwin 9 packages)
A good backup since there is absolutely no guarantees
Please contact us in <span style="border-collapse:separate">#puredarwin on irc.freenode.net if you want to be a tester.</span>
