Generic platform kext for PureDarwin
====================================
Reader <span style="color:rgb(34,34,34);font-family:arial,sans-serif">Rafirafi sent us source code for </span>a new kext, ClockRTC, and patches<span style="color:rgb(34,34,34);font-family:arial,sans-serif"> that make it possible to use </span>Apple8259PIC-6, AppleI386GenericPlatform-5, AppleI386PCI-6 with PureDarwin on generic hardware (only tested on QEMU). He thinks this will be useful<span style="color:rgb(34,34,34);font-family:arial,sans-serif"> for people who are interested in running Darwin without proprietary kexts. Note, however, that this is not a full ACPI platform kext and it will likely only work on QEMU.</span>
