CFNetwork
=========

CFNetwork is a companion to CoreFoundation, and provides key networking features to applications.

While it was available as part of Darwin 8 (OS X 10.4), with the release of Darwin 9 (OS X 10.5) it became closed source. However, the source code for the last version released under Darwin 8 is still available from Apple, and with minor patching can be made to compile in the darwinbuild chroot.

CFNetwork is part of the CoreServices umbrella framework. CoreServices itself is a basic stub, existing solely to link to the framework under it.


Below as an attachement is a binary version of <span style="font-style:italic">CFNetwork.framework</span>, wrapped inside a <span style="font-style:italic">CoreServices.framework</span>.
Also included is the <span style="font-style:italic">CarbonCore.framework</span>, which contains only header files.

#### Status and testing to date
Code written, compiled and linked to CoreServices on OS X will run successfully on PureDarwinXmas.
The CFNetService type (the only part tested so far) operates correctly.

This software is covered by the [APSL](../legal/apsl.html).
